I’m Ting (Ashley), a curious and actively-learning software engineer who loves building practical systems. I often go by **Ashley with friends**, but in **work or academic settings** I typically go by **Ting** :)

I’m especially interested in topics like crypto currency, distributed systems, cybersecurity, and ML model applications.

I am also very open to **collaboration or volunteering**, especially in areas related to **gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights** — feel free to DM me!

## 🚀 What I Do

### 🧠 AI + Data Engineering  
At **PayPal**, I built a multi-agent LLM chatbot system for the Pricing team using differenct LLMs.
It translates natural language into SQL, runs BigQuery analysis, and returns pricing insights with **over 90% accuracy**.

- Designed a JSON-RAG workflow with Milvus vector fallback search  
- Integrated multiple ML models for generating pricing insights  
- Reduced response latency by **80%** through smart caching & preloading  
- Packaged everything as an MCP server for seamless internal use

### ⚙️ Full-stack Engineering  
At **Adsgency AI**:  
- Implemented OAuth 2.0 (Pinterest login)  
- Improved CDN performance +15% via CloudFront + Gzip  
- Cut front-end render time by 30% using React.lazy + Redux optimization  
- Built CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions  

At **Baile Food Co.**:  
- Designed MySQL databases on Alibaba Cloud  
- Achieved 40%+ faster queries with efficient indexing  
- Used Redis caching + WebSockets for real-time WeChat Mini Program updates  

(Yes, I really enjoy squeezing milliseconds out of systems.)

### 📚 Teaching & Mentorship  
Former full-time **R programming lecturer** for 1,500+ college students.  
I love explaining complex ideas in simple ways.

## ⭐ Favorite Personal Project

### 🔗 **Solana Insight & Alert Engine**  
**Repo:** https://github.com/Ting-Lii/Solana-Insight-Alert-Engine

A serverless system that monitors Solana sentiment by collecting data from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds, analyzing it with ML models (VADER and FinBERT), and triggering alerts for sentiment drops, volume spikes, and FUD keywords. Built with Java Spring Boot and Python ML, deployed on AWS using Lambda functions, API Gateway, EventBridge, and DynamoDB, with load testing and performance validation. The system provides real-time sentiment tracking and automated alerts via Discord webhooks, enabling proactive monitoring of market sentiment shifts.

It's one of my favorite personal projects so far because it combines my interests in **crypto currency**, **real-time systems**, **ML model applications**, and **cloud-native architecture**. It’s genuinely practical for my own use 😄.
